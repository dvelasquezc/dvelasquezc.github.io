	<span> <p>I am a Research Assistant at Universidad del Pacífico, and I am currently working for <a href="https://scholar.google.com.pe/citations?user=qV3OqlUAAAAJ&hl=es&oi=ao">Gustavo Yamada</a>. 
	I have completed a M.Sc in Economics at Universidad del Pacifico (where I ranked 1st place out of the thirteen master programs) and I will be applying for a PhD program in Economics by the end of 2018.</p> </span>

	<p>Right now, my fields of interest include labor economics and development economics, both with a focus on economic geography and urban economics. 
	In fact, I have presented my <a href="{{ "/research/exploration_agglomeration.html" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}">master degree thesis</a> 
	on the <a href="https://economics.smu.edu.sg/urban2017">SMU Conference of Urban and Regional Economics</a>. 
	It has also been accepted in the <a href="http://www.urbaneconomics.org/meetings/uea2018/">13th Meeting of the Urban Economic Association</a> and in the <a href="https://www.lacealames.com/">2018 Annual Conference of LACEA-LAMES</a>.</p>

	<p>Previously, I was a Research Assistant at <a href="http://www.grade.org.pe/en/">GRADE</a> (Group for the Analysis of Development) where I worked for <a href="http://www.grade.org.pe/en/investigadores/personal/jvaldivi/">Martín Valdivia.</a></p>
	
	<p> Aside from academics, I enjoy reading literature (from classics as William Shakespeare to more contemporaneous authors as Milan Kundera) and playing drums.</p>
