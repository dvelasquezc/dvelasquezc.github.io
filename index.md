			<span class="text"> <p> Welcome to my homepage!</p></span>
			<span class="text"> <p> I am an applicant to a PhD program in Economics. My fields of interest include development and labor economics, both with a focus on economic geography and urban economics.
			Broadly speaking, I am currently studying how external shocks (e.g. mining and trade liberalization) affect microeconomic markets, among other research projects. </p></span>
	
			<span class="text"> <p> I have completed a M.Sc in Economics at Universidad del Pacifico. I am a recipient of the Robert Maes of the Graduate School prize, which is given to the student with 
			the highest GPA among the thirteen master programs offered by the university.</p></span>
	
			<span class="text"> <p> I have presented my <a href="{{ "/research/exploration_agglomeration.html" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}">master degree thesis</a> 
			(advisor: <a href="https://jorgedelaroca.name/">Jorge de la Roca</a>) on the <a href="https://economics.smu.edu.sg/urban2017">SMU Conference of Urban and Regional Economics</a>,

			<span class="text"> <p> I am currently working with <a href="https://scholar.google.com.pe/citations?user=qV3OqlUAAAAJ&hl=es&oi=ao">Gustavo Yamada</a> at Universidad del Pacifico. Feel free to check out our <a href="{{ "/research" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}">work</a>. 
			I am also coauthoring an interesting project about <a href="{{ "/research/trade_violence.html" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}">trade liberalization and domestic violence</a> with <a href ="https://www.poverty-action.org/people/alberto-chong">Alberto Chong</a>.
			Previously, I was a research assistant at <a href="http://www.grade.org.pe/en/">GRADE</a> (Group for the Analysis of Development) where I assisted 
			<a href="http://www.grade.org.pe/en/investigadores/personal/jvaldivi/">Martín Valdivia</a> mainly in two RCTs.</p></span>
	
			<span class="text"><p> Aside from academics, I enjoy reading literature (from classics as William Shakespeare to more contemporaneous authors as Milan Kundera) and playing drums.</p></span>
