abstract: 'Whereas computer technologies increase productivity, they also diminish discrimination by reducing discretion in situations of monopoly power in the public sector. We exploit two natural field experiments related to the renewal of identification cards in Bolivia to show that, as expected, applicants randomly assigned to a computer process are more likely to complete renewal faster as compared to those assigned to a manual one. More interestingly, we also find that computers help reduce discrimination based on observable characteristics, such as age, gender, and rural-urban background. Finally, we find that corruption may be reduced too, as it typically goes hand in hand with discrimination issues.'
