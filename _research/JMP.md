abstract: 'Since 1950, suburban counties have grown into major population and employment hubs, while urban cores have declined. This shift in the distribution of population and employment coincides with the construction of the Interstate Highway System. Highways reduced the cost of moving workers (via commuting) and goods (via trade).  I leverage variation in highway construction dates and driving time reductions to show that new highways induce both trade and commuting shocks. I find that, on average, trade access, not commuting access, is a key driver of population and employment growth.  I develop a quantitative model of trade, commuting, migration, and scale externalities, and map it to my reduced-form results through indirect inference.  When trade costs fall, locations benefiting from these reductions enjoy lower goods prices, attracting migrants. Moreover, reduced travel times to jobs, make areas enjoying these benefits more desirable places to live. Since the strength of migration responses depends on amenity externalities, the model requires amenity externalities to rationalize the empirical findings. Using my calibrated model, simulations show highways account for 15 percent of suburban growth and 33 percent of the decline in urban cores. Trade costs reductions, and not only commute costs reductions, shape suburbanization patterns.'
