abstract: "Crime perception has increased in Peru, as in other developing and developed countries, in spite of the reduction in crime victimization figures. Our hypothesis is that the news industry is partially responsible for such opposing trends, as Peruvians are great consumers of written news. Using a unique database of most news from the Peruvian written press, we georeference the location of each reported crime to identify short-term deviations from trend in the coverage of crime news at the province level and estimate their effect on crime perception. We measure coverage as the area an article occupies in cm2. We find that a spike of negative crime news increases people's perception about the probability of being a crime victim. The effect of positive news is opposite. However, the effect per cm2 of negative news is around three times larger than the effect of positive news in absolute value, signaling a potential asymmetry in the revision of people's expectations. These perception changes are smaller for recent crime victims than for non-victims. Moreover, perception changes are mostly driven by increases in the fear of house and car theft and common street crime, rather than more violent crimes like kidnapping or sexual abuse. We also explore how media coverage impacts institutional trust and show that individuals distribute accountability and reward unevenly between the main justice and security institutions."
