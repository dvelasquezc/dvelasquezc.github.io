abstract: 'We are currently carrying out the field work. We are sending messages to rent income debtors. These messages refer to the prevailing social norms (how most of the people pay) and the civic duty (why it is important to pay taxes) in order to evaluate whether these messages increase compliance. To understand the mechanisms behind, we will carry out an endline survey. Finally, we will evaluate the existence of spillovers on taxpayers' coworkers and neighbors.'
