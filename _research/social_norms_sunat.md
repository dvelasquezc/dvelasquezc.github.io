abstract: 'Developing countries typically experience high evasion rates, which greatly hinders their ability to provide public goods and services. In this study, we carry out a randomized controlled trial in six districts of Lima, Peru to evaluate the short- and long-term effects of three different types of messages on the payment of the rental income tax. We designed these messages drawing insights from the traditional or standard theory of tax compliance, from the theory of social norms and from altruism motives. Contrary to what is commonly believed, sending these messages is not exempt of certain risks and hidden costs as individuals may adjust their behavior regarding the particular tax addressed in the messages at the expense of other taxes. We find this to be the case in our context. Failing to take into account this margin of adjustment may lead to the overestimation of the true benefits of the intervention. To get a better understanding the underlying mechanisms and particularities of our results, we conduct a post-intervention survey.'
