abstract: 'What is the impact of improving the transit infrastructure on the gender earnings gap? How family structure matters to understand the impact of new transit infrastructure? Recent models on spatial economics hinge on the assumption that households are comprised of a single type of person making commuting and location choices. In reality, an important share of the population live in households comprised of more persons, whose commuting choices might be interlinked through the household&apos;s budget constraint. I set up and estimate a quantitative model of city structure featuring single and married households leveraging on the introduction of a Metro line and the Bus Rapid Transit System in Lima, Peru. My model delivers interdependent commuting choices within dual-earner households. This way, reduced commute times impact one partner&apos;s commuting patterns not only by affecting her prospects, but also those of her spouse. I show that this mechanism is quantitative important. If I ignore this mechanism, I would underestimate gains in real income by 42 percent and reductions in the gender earnings gap by 72 percent.'
