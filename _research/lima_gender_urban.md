abstract: 'What is the impact of improving the transit infrastructure on the gender earnings gap? Does the income structure within households, that is, the number and gender of income earners, play a role in understanding the impact of new transit infrastructure? An important share of the population lives in households with multiple members, whose commuting choices might be interlinked through the household&apos;s budget constraint. As the wage of one of the spouses increases and secures a higher standard of living, households are willing to give up more of the other spouse&apos;s income to decrease commute costs. This way, reduced commute times impact one partner&apos;s commuting patterns not only by affecting her prospects, but also those of her spouse. I set up a quantitative model of city structure featuring single and married households leveraging on the introduction of a Metro line and the Bus Rapid Transit System (BRT) in Lima, Peru. My model delivers interdependent commuting choices within dual-earner households featuring a gravity structure. In the counterfactual analysis, I find that the gender gap in aggregate earnings decreased by over 13 percent in remote areas where access increased the most. Conclusions would change substantially if I use a model with independent commuting choices. '
