abstract: 'How does economic geography shape the household wage structure? Within a household, commuting and employment decisions are linked through a shared utility function and budget constraint. Therefore, improving commute times can affect one partner&apos;s commuting patterns by impacting both their prospects (direct channel) and those of their spouse (indirect channel). I set up a quantitative model of city featuring single and married households leveraging the introduction of new transit infrastructure in Lima, Peru. In the counterfactual analysis, I find that in areas with the most improved transportation, the gender gap in real earnings among married households decreased by 12 percent. However, the gap remained unchanged among single households. Further analysis shows that the gap decreased through the direct channel but increased through the indirect channel.'
