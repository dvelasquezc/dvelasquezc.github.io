abstract: 'We exploit unexpected and drastic tarffs reductions in Peru during the 2000s. We find that in districts where male employment was more vulnerable to these reductions, we observe a statistically significant increase in intimate partner violence with respect to less vulnerable districts. Our results are robust to falsification, placebo, and permutation tests, initial conditions, con ation of past and current shocks, migration, and intermediate inputs considerations. Our findings are consistent with the theory of exposure whereby increased physical interaction in the household, for instance due to unemployment, may result in increased domestic violence and may be furthered triggered by alcohol consumption.'
