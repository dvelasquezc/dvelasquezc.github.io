abstract: 'We study the effect of trade liberalization on the incidence of domestic violence in Peru. We exploit the pre-2007-reform industrial composition of male and female employment in par with tariff changes to compute a measure of male exposure to trade liberalization. We find that for every p.p. decrease in our measure of exposure, domestic violence increased in 0.6 p.p. Furthermore, we show that the main link between trade liberalization and domestic violence is the labor market: when female labor opportunities are enhanced, the women with low bargaining power experiences more violence, as suggested by the male-backlash theory. However, when the women with high bargaining power have better opportunities, they do not experience a rise in violence.'
