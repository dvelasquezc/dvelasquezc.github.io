abstract: 'We study the effect of trade liberalization on the incidence of domestic violence in Peru. We exploit the pre-2007-reform industrial composition of male and female employment in par with tariff changes to compute two measures of exposure to trade liberalization, in a similar vein as in Dix-Carneiro and Kovak (2015). We find that a decrease of 1 percentage point in tariff protection for men, increased the probability of female suffering physical domestic violence in about 2 percentage points. This imply that between 2004 and 2011, a district in which male were exposed to the mean reduction in tariffs, physical violence increased in 20 percentage points relative to other districts. Female exposure to the trade reform reduced domestic violence (but this difference was not statistically significant). We then demonstrate that these impacts are driven by the unskilled females (i.e. those with a low level of bargaining power). Furthermore, we show that the main link between trade liberalization and domestic violence is the labor market: male exposure to tariff cuts increased employment for both the unskilled and skilled female. This suggests that when female labor opportunities are enhanced, women with low bargaining power experiences more violence, as suggested by the male-backlash theory. However, when women with high bargaining power have better opportunities, they do not experience a rise in violence.'
