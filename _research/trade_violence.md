abstract: 'We study the effect of trade liberalization on domestic violence in Peru. We exploit the pre-2007-reform industrial composition of male and female employment in par with tariff changes to compute two measures of exposure to tariff cuts: male and female tariff cuts. We find that, between 2004 and 2011, physical violence increased in 20 percentage points in districts exposed to the average male tariff cut, relatively to other districts. This impact is driven by the unskilled females (i.e. those with a low level of bargaining power). We show that the labor market is main link between trade liberalization and domestic violence: male tariff cuts increased employment for the unskilled and skilled female. This suggests that women with low bargaining power suffer more violence when they have more opportunities&mdash;as suggested by the male-backlash theory. However, when women with high bargaining power have better opportunities, they do not suffer a rise in violence&mdash;as explained by the bargaining power theory.'
