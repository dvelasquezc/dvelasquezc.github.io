abstract: 'We study the impact of mining explorations on the Peruvian local economy. The identification strategy is a difference-in-differences (DID) estimation. The treatment and control group were determined using the precise location of explorations and a buffer of 15 km radius. The main findings are that mining explorations increased hourly wages, monthly working hours and rents. Furthermore, gains from these investments were not limited to the mining industry: there were spillovers toward other industries.'
