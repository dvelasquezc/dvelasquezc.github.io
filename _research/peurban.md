abstract: 'We show that agglomeration effects in Peru are much larger for informal sector workers than for formal ones. This finding is not in line with the strong complementarity observed in developed countries between skills (i.e., formal sector workers) and city size. We conjecture that formal workers have a limited choice set of cities and locate in a few big cities. Small and medium cities do not have the amenities and quality of services that formal workers demand and, hence, they need to be compensated with higher earnings to move there. We model the services that formal workers demand as a non-tradable good that requires some fixed production cost (e.g., building a theater, museum, private school). The relatively few formal workers who live in small and medium cities cannot cover the fixed costs and demand higher compensation due to the lack of adequate services. In equilibrium, most formal workers decide to locate in a few big cities, and given this concentration, wages adjust downwards.'
